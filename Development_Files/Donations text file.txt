!!You can be the 85th donator!!!


PLEASE DONATE TO THE APOCALYPSE MOD TEAM TODAY!!!!
Why provide donations? You get lots of stuff from us, including a continued campaign that is yet unfinished and loads of support and mod fixes. This is not a requirement, and by donating, the Apocalypse mod team will be active doing up the mod, releasing updates, and providing more epic entertainment than fooling around with other stuff.

Why provide donations? Over 50 members have, and they were rewarded with what they wanted to see in the UA mod, and because of them, this mod is continued in development. We have explored it all in this mod, and we are not inspired by passion anymore, so by these wonderful donations, well, just look at the progress!

This is no requirement, you are not forced to make any transaction, it is all optional, very appreciated, you can be put in the list of donators, and further, you get to boss us around and have at what you want!

So what are you waiting for? Donate!


Those who have donated in the past have unlocked many upon many features from before the Grand Release. They have convinced us to give the crowd updates almost immediately, and that the UA team did! From keeping everything secret and confidential with no updates for as long as possible to make a perfect release, fans began to donate and were given updates, new exclusive trailers and patches including the very first 1.59 Complete Collection version, then the following patches such as, 1.6, 1.61, 1.62, 1.63, 1.64, and finally 1.65 and bonus maps content to keep the donators happy. With all those donations combined, it is obvious a Grand Release is needed and sooner than imaginable.
