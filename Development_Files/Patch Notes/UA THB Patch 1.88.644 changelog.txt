--- TODO ---
------------

I have not fixed yet: (this changes list was taken from discord quite some time ago and entries I fulfilled are not shown here on top)
1) GK Purgators DPS is too high even against armored targets (Because I didn't test the new one yet)
2) DS turrets can still attack ground with global range
3) Aircrafts are defined as "broken"
4) Titans are too cost effective
5) Reinforce transport ability MUST NOT be used on orks
6) IG General is not available if the General Reaver Titan has been deployed

Leader fixes to avoid redundancy in files and researches
- Cultist and Renegades squads now have chaos_aspiring_champion as leader
- General has the same commissar as Cadets
- Colonel has the same Sergeant as Kasrkins

- Incarcerator ability description and name are missing
- Incarcerator HP regen description would currently be a lie
- The righteous ability of the assassin UI description should be updated (it currently is aboout repentia sisters)
- Fix taurox UI/abilities
- Fix eldar's invisibility (gates)
- merge spinegaunt and termagant
- change SM lascannons
- rework terminator assault cannons
- warriors should have scything claws/devourers. Devourer replaceable with:
	rending claws, good AP infantry but not against vehicles.
	ranged venomcannons attack animation attack projectile more lik
	deathspitters radiate an aura that increases the ranged dmg of nearby allied nids by 5% per deathspitter in the squad. not stacking
	take away their bioplasma,
	Barbed strangler AOE pseudogrenadelauncher that slows down and disables jumps. animation would be that of the current deathspitter
	Venom cannon heavy anti vehicle weapon that can not be fired on the move. projectile would be the one of the heavy necron destroyer. theyre supposed to fire a hail of green crystals,
	!!!!! a warriors squad can only get either ONE venom cannon or ONE barbed strangler
	other weapon upgrade can be scrapped
- warriors would be a fairly durable but expensive unit overall as in, less armor than marines but significantly more health
- Prevent shifted units from being attacked (maybe add minimum health when you cannot help it): doomsday_monolith - necron_lord!! - necon_pylon - necron_overseer - tomb_stalker wraith
- Prevent angels from being attacked
- Fix 8p Ultimate apocalypse map when spawning titan (maybe tau)

- so the haemonculus laboratory has 2 researches + warp beast tamers have 2 new abilities + 2 new abilities were created + warp beasts without tamer can teleport after research + warp beast tamer modifier_apply_ext disables squad flight + warp beasts have melee ext + warp beast modifier apply ext disables hardpoint 5 (weapon unlocked by having both warp beast master and artefacts research) + warp beast weapon moved from hardpoint 2 to 4 + one new weapon in hardpoint 5
- Greater Knarlocks and Clawed Fiends no longer have squad_reinforce_ext and their loadout is now limited to 1 (1. They could destroy any other relic unit and they cost less if reinforced. 2. Their relic cost could be glitched and you could gain 150 additional relic if the first trooper died)
- Removed eldar radars + support platforms don't have the radar addon anymore (eldar_support_platform_addon_probe) + Dcannon addon no longer is incompatible with radar
- Make titanportal sight bonus not a multiplicative value and update description
- eldar ground titans movement reworked. acceleration 0 -> 0.25, rotation speed 10000 -> 300 Phantom and 10000 -> 600 Revenant, speed of the revenant reduced 60 -> 45, turning_behaviour_template walker -> squiggoth

- Completely reworked AP and damages of ground titan weapons (Scaled AP to make the biggest 100 and multiplied damage for that factor. Eldar titans dealt almost triple damages compared to other titans. Therefore damage was drastically reduced as well by /2 up to /3): eldar_pulsar_phantom_titan_left, eldar_pulsar_phantom_titan_right, eldar_sonic_laser_revenant_titan_left, eldar_sonic_laser_revenant_titan_right. (Eldar sonic lasers vulnerability debuff has been completely removed like on all brightlances)
- Increased min range of the following ground titans main weapons: Revenant(default) to 10m, Revenant(upgraded) to 20m, Phantom(default) weapons to 15m

- CD buildings no longer have daemon_structure_fire_fx1, daemon_structure_fire_fx2, daemon_structure_fire_fx3 since they are useless. These 3 files should be removed
- Monolith no longer has two useless abilities necron_production_modifier and necron_production_modifier_anti. necron_production_modifier_anti has also been removed (the other causes a crash but I couldn't track down the cause)
- Space Marines Essence Of The Machine Spirit no longer affects EVERYTHING with +50% health and +50% Max damage. It's effects are now limited to all vehicle types and aircrafts as it should be
- Necron Mass Resurrection Overseer (passive) no longer resurrects nearby fallen corpses but increases resurrection chance by 10% and increases health regeneration by 10. Wargear's description is properly updated
- Necron Mass Resurrection Monolith cooldown increased 120 -> 180 and power cost increased 0 -> 600. Cooldown is shared with other Monolith Resurrection as well
- Necron Mass Resurrection Lychguard cooldown increased 60 -> 180 and power cost increased 0 -> 300. Cooldown is shared with other Lychguard Resurrection as well
- Necron Mass Resurrection Destroyer cooldown increased 180 -> 200 and power cost increased 0 -> 400. Cooldown is shared with Mass Resurrection as well
- Necron Mass Resurrection cooldown increased 180 -> 200 and power cost increased 0 -> 400. Cooldown is shared with Mass Resurrection Destroyer as well
- All necron corpses aside from Tomb Spyders and Tomb Stalkers cannot be revived after 120 seconds from their death and consequently disappear (necron_basic_warrior_body, necron_deathmark_body, necron_flayed_one_body, necron_immortal_body, necron_lychguard_body, necron_wraith_body)

- Addon Necron List Post 1 time cost increased by 15 seconds 35 -> 50 but power cost reduced by 30 60 -> 30
- Increased the movement speed of most Necron infantry units: Basic Warrior 7 -> 8, Flayed Ones 5.8 -> 6.5, Immortal 7 -> 8.25
- Marines Burnout ability (CSM and SM Bikes) has completely different armour penetrations, damages and morale damages (overall drastically lowered)
- Space Marines Tactical Bike and Chaos Marine Bike armour type changed from vehicle to elite heavy infantry (it must be infantry since they are MEN on BIKES and not the opposite). Minimum Armour and Armour values are both increased by 3
- Disambiguated the weapon of the Damocles else it is improved the the infantry injection and infantry researches as well. A _damocles version has been created. Damocles file consequently updated
- Changed the default weapon of Predator Executioners into space_marine_inferno_cannon_predator which seems more suitable than guard_inferno_cannon_leman_russ
- Emperor's Armoury is now limited to 1 (prevents buffs from stacking)
- Hellsmith can no longer use the Forced Labor ability
- Deleted 1 wrong Hammerhand from the Inquisition Grey Knight Strike Team
- Techpriests are no longer able to throw grenades

----------------

----------------------------------
--- Applied changes before Git ---
----------------------------------



	Abilities: The first line will ONLY contain abilities unlocked by the relative wargear (NEW) (research with same name, see effects ingame or into the research description. Extension _2 _3 and so on after the _n.wargear meant that it is a child called by the previous ability)

all_run! in now incompatible with Fleet on Foot and Feet on Fire
all_autorepair now causes a fixed income debuff instead of a percentage (Req/Pow) -10%/-10% -> -10/-5
all_bumpertank_child now has 2 different entries set to true {target_ground and target_self}. This should prevent shield damages for the user

Following superweapons (not winbuttons) have the local addon_superweapon requirement to allow the Tau Arka cannon to use "Ceasefire" without requiring such addon: chaos_nuke + chaos_warp_storm_super_world_end , daemons_warp_storm + daemons_warp_storm_super_world_end + daemons_planetary_extermination, marines_nuke + marines_nuke2 + marines_nuke3 + marines_nuke4, inquisition_nuke2, inquisition_exterminatus, sisters_nuke + sisters_nuke2 + sisters_nuke3 + sisters_nuke4, tyranids_planetary_bombardment + tyranids_summon_hivefleet + tyranids_summon_vein, tau_nuke + tau_arka_ion_cannon
Following Superweapon buildings now have different modifier_apply_ext (not disabling abilities [previous sentence makes abilities require the addon]): chaos_hq_super + daemon_doom_pit + guard_nuclear_facility + inquisition_nuclear_facility + sisters_missile_silo + space_marine_hq_super + tau_arka_ion_cannon + tyranids_capillary_tower

all_generator_bonus (productivity/requisition) now has smaller radius 12->8
all_transport_abilityrecharge no longer increases ability range, ability recharge rate buff now is exclusive, the target_filter now contains only infantry units as targets instead of everyone (titans as well). The skill no longer affects the caster.
all_transport_heal no longer applies +30% health regen. Constant health regen buff increased 15 -> 20 and now is exclusive. it STILL affects the caster.

LP: Each race has it's own. Passive Healing / morale aura at LP addon III, Passive repairing aura (building + resource drain) at LP addon IV
	Daemons have 4 exclusive AOE of "Chains of Torment" and contain the manifestation of an Undivided Prince's wargear.
	Tyranids don't have weapons but passive skills (AOE of damages and debuffs centered on the LP), one per addon.

SHARED:
	(CSM, SM, IG) shared_dozer_blade_upgrade_ability

CSM: Chaos lord = 6. Champion of Khorne. Nurgle and Slaanesh = 2. Champion of Tzeentch = 4 (not shared). Lord of Change = 10. Bloodthirster = 8. Great Unclean One = 4. Keeper of Secrets = 4. Daemon Prince = 4. Sorcerer = 2 (if chosen mark is Khorne, unlocked by levels 6-7). Sorcerer Lord = 1 (unlocked by the Oracular Dais [new content]). Invulnerability, Bolt of Change and Chains of Torment spells are now incompatible with a new wargear of the LoC (n.8). Tainted Auspex and Daemon Strength are incompatible with two Chaos Lord new wargears. 
	+1 Champion of Nurgle (passive from the very beginning. 20m radius +6 health regen, pretty simple indeed)
	+1 Disambiguation ability: Doom Siren for Noise Marines (needed for compatibility with a disabled part of my addon)
	Meteors spell no longer shares the cooldown between casters
	Skill cooldowns amplified (base value, buffs aside) [there are too many casters. skill spamming must be avoided at all costs. Using all commanders skills even once per fight would certainly bring it to premature end]:
		Meteors: 180 -> 320
		Corruption: 120 -> 160
		Chains of Torment: 80 -> 90
[sorcerer]	Bolts of Change: 60 -> 40 [lvl. 3-4]
[Sorcerer]	Bolts of Change Improved: 120 -> 100 [lvl. 5-6]
[Sorcerer]	Bolts of Change Greater: 120 -> 170 [lvl. 7-8]
[Sorcerer Lord]	Bolts of Change Greater Lord: 120 -> 170
		Storm of Change: 290 -> 600
		Rift: 30 -> 50
		Winds of Change: 120 -> 300
[Lord of Change]Bolts of Change: 16 -> 160
		Warp Storm Mini: 200 -> 240

	Storm of change no longer has the eldrich storm as child and damage is increased accordingly to compensate (its way weaker. Now it is very similar to the eldritch storm)

	Buff of Nurgle (passive of almost all entities that only requires to have chosen the mark) now is a bit stronger because it was really no match to other buffs (I still doubt it does but it should still be better for vehicles in later game). HP regen +2 -> +4

	+2 Aspiring sorcerer (chaos_shield_aspiring_sorcerer and chaos_shield_regenerate_aspiring_sorcerer)
	Following bolts of change can now target a non enemy unit to cast, not sparing allies with the first bolt: chaos_bolt_of_change, chaos_bolt_of_change_aspiringsorcerer, chaos_bolt_of_change_greater, chaos_bolt_of_change_greater_lord, chaos_bolt_of_change_improved, chaos_bolt_of_change_psyker
	Sorcerers BoC (Bolts of Change Improved,Bolts of Change Greater) now point to different childs, producing respectively 2 and 3 BoC projectiles
	Sorcerer Lord (Bolts of Change Greater Lord) now points to a different child, producing only 4 projectiles

	Eye of the Warp (HQ ability now has global cooldown)

	+7 new abilities used by new leaders chaos_: - cultist_leader_aura + cultist_leader_ceremonial_knives + plague_leader_aura + noise_leader_aura + berserker_leader_aura + chaos_new_noise_champion2_freq_low + chaos_new_noise_champion2_freq_high
	chaos_selfdestruct ability causes more health degeneration 30 -> 50 to cause the death of the Wheel
	All 5 abilities of inspiring banners have been altered as they stacked way too many times. They are now RESTRICTED TO THE SQUAD of the banner bearer but their effects are amplified:
		chaos_inspiring_aura_bearer: max morale 100 -> 250, morale regen 2 -> 5
		chaos_inspiring_aura_bearer_tzeentch: nothing
		chaos_inspiring_aura_bearer_khorne: max damage 15% -> 20%, min damage 15% -> 25%
		chaos_inspiring_aura_bearer_nurgle: hp regen 2 -> 6
		chaos_inspiring_aura_bearer_slaanesh: speed 20% -> 25%, max morale 100 -> 200, morale regen 2 -> 4
	Nerfed cultist worships. Worships no longer affect structures, vehicles, titans and the caster squad. Their cooldowns are now global as well, so only one can be used at a time in normal circumstances.
		worship_worship (applied by default to the caster squad): Caster squad becomes unable to reinforce or upgrade weapons and is revealed for the whole durations
		Tzeentch: MODIFIERS UNCHANGED
		Khorne: Stacks with other bonuses.
		Nurgle: Stacks with other bonuses. Health regen reduced 40 -> 25
		Slaanesh: Stacks with other bonuses. Max morale +200% -> +40%. Speed +200% -> +40%

CD: Hellspawn = 4. Khorne Herald = 1. Nurgle Herald = 2. Slaanesh Herald = 3. Tzeentch Herald = 3. Daemon Lord/Stature = 1. Daemon Prince of Undivided = 4 (+2 additional shared ones). Murder gaze is incompatible with an upgraded version of itself.
	Updated the requirements of Murder Gaze
	Angron has a global aura (level8) which greatly increases damages/productivity/health of the Daemons' army [since he can buy levels but did not get any benefit from them]				|
	+1 to Flesh Hounds (toggle between anti infantry and anty vehicle weapon. Stronger when selecting Khorne Mark)												|
	+1 Bloodletters (bloodbath, damage enemy infantry around [weak blood pulse])																|
	+3 Nurgling (like Plague Marines fumigating smoke/death feedback I II)																	|
	+4 Plague Bearers (stronger fumigating smoke that partially affects allies too [daemonic larvae] / long term targeted health degeneration + share sight [daemonic parasite]/death feedback I II)	| Long story short, skills for everybody
	+2 Fiend of Slaanesh (attack speed at the cost of hp regen / stasis like [Swiftness of Pleasure / Unbearable pain])											|	
	+2 Daemonette (mark squad / unpredicted stab)																				|
	+2 Favoured Daemonette (cloack of darkness/unforseen evocation)																		|
	+4 Flamer of Tzeentch (fireball/death feedback I II/Inferno flame)																			|
	+3 Pink Horror (Curse of the machine spirit [highly corrosive bolt]/doombolt/armour piercing blast)													|
	+2 Screamer (Scream [knockback] / anti armour scream [resonant])																	|
	Death feedback {nurglings,plague bearers,flamers of tzeentch} is shared, the same identical ability (but has different consequences due to the death blossom). Each skill only has greater chance of activating
	Increased the damage done by the Nurgle Prince/Herald by 50% (rot [greater] [active skills]) 15-20 -> 22-30 and 20-25 -> 30-38
	Great Unclean One has the skill "Greater Rot", the same one as the Nurgle Prince [skill not new]
	Flame Tongue has +25% damages (Lord/Prince): 200-350 -> 250-440 and 300-550 -> 375-700
	Herald of Tzeentch no longer has the passive ability "disable_flight"
	Warp Portal ability requires Portal gift [9] instead of HQ for display
	+1 [daemons_wargear_herald_of_slaanesh_2_warped_plant_aura] used by the new entity

	+1 to a new entity generated by Warp Signatures after death under certain conditions

	Daemons_listening_post_protection1, Daemons_listening_post_protection2, Daemons_listening_post_protection3 now have different modifier values: health regen {+5%,+5%,+5%,+3} -> {+1,+1.5,+2.5}, maximum health {+4%,+4%,+4%,+6%} -> {+3%,+4%,+5%,+6%}

	Doom Blast (Hellspawn) now costs 650 less power to cast 1000 -> 350

	Daemons_listening_post_protection3 [passive that requires addon II] radius increased by 5 (25 -> 30) so that it matches all other increments (else it would be the same as the previous ability, which does not make sense)
	Daemons_listening_post_protection3_child1 radius increased by 10 (50 -> 60) so that it matches all other increments (else it would be the same as the previous ability, which does not make sense)

	daemons_nurgle_herald_aura (passively casted by the Nurgle Herald) now has +2m radius 18 -> 20. Hit events contain "narthicium" (FX like a white ring used by many healing skills like this one). Now it increases health regen by +4 and x1.5 instead of simply x2 and it affects entities instead of squads


	daemons_bolt_of_change_loc can now target a non enemy unit to cast, not sparing allies with the first bolt
	daemons_gift_of_tzeentch can now hurt allies and has a different projectile

	Doom (divine_obliteration) now deals much more damage 820-1080 -> 1220-1680. Morale damage doubled, 100 -> 200
	Greater Flame Tongue (warpfire_prince) now deals much more damage 375-700 -> 550-1350. Morale damage increased, 70(or 80 I don't remember) -> 180
	Hellmouth (warpfire_roar and all its child abilities) now deals much more damage 475-680 -> 540-890. Morale damage doubled, 10 -> 90

	Added many chained meteors with some different stats: chaos_meteors_chain_child, chaos_meteors_chain_child01 ... chaos_meteors_chain_child09. {note, the name chaos_ is due to the fact that I had different plans for this ability}
	Changed the Summon Mini Warp Storm (level8) [daemons_warp_storm_mini_lord] as it's not even close to the tactical explosive but has more range: Fire Cost (power) 0 -> 600. Recharge Time 200 -> 500. Range 90 -> 60. Refresh Time 4 -> 5. Duration 18 -> 5. Child ability now is chaos_meteors_chain_child [previous entry] (more meteors would fall but since duration/refresh are lowered, less meteors will actually fall). Target all -> enemy. Radius 18 -> 40. Areasweep circle[2] -> none[0]. Damage 121-213 -> 230-512. Morale damages 31 -> 330. Armour penetration lowered: { Basic infantry 10 -> 25. Infantry 150 -> 25. Elite Infantry 150 -> 25. Heavy Infantry 150 -> 35. Elite Heavy Infantry 150 -> 35. Monsters 150 -> 75. Daemons 150 -> 100. Commanders 150 -> 50. Vehicle 150 -> 50. Armoured Vehicle 150 -> 75. Heavily Armoured Vehicle 150 -> 100. Structure 30 -> 75. Fortified Structure 30 -> 75. Heavily Fortified Structure 20 -> 75. Super Structure 10 -> 50. Aircraft 150 -> 175. Living Metal 3.75 -> 40. Titan 125 -> 60.}
	Disambiguated the Summon Mini Warp storm so that the Prince and the Lord have 2 different skills (changes cost, recharge time and range) [Prince's ability is the new one]

	+9 abilities unlocked by the new daemons_greater_gift_ researches. (Bloodthirster = 1 + 10 child, LoC = 2 + 8 child, GUO = 1, KoS = 2, All = (shared) 1)

DE: Haemonculus = 6. Haemonculi Ancient = 6 active + 1 passive (shield).
	Wildfire and its child abilities have tweaked requirements (no apparent change but it's better the way it is now)
	New skill: forced labor (basic buildings) greatly increase building speed for a short time at the cost of some souls.
	New ability: Portal Healing II, which can be researched in portals and allows buildings and vehicles to be repaired as well.
	Portal healing becomes incompatible with Portal healing II.
	1 Passive ability implemented for the Soulstorm spawned by the Haemonculi Ancient
	2 Passive abilities implemented for the Torture Amps spawned by the Haemonculi Ancient
	3 Passive auras implemented for the walls (after add-ons)
	Rekindle Rage (file is called corrosive_cloud if you, like me, are not used to how DE names match) healing time reduced 5 -> 0.5 seconds, meaning it only heals 500 per affected unit
	haywire_bombs damage and armour penetration drastically lowered to match other races' Krak Grenades
	haywire_bombs_sp (only used by the Archon) has slightly different UI description to state that it's a more powerful Haywire Grenade
	Feet on fire (dark_eldar_footonfire) now applies a great accuracy debuff for the whole duration (-60% melee/ranged) and the speed bonus is reduced x4(not stack) -> +50%(can stack)

ELDAR: Autarch = 1 (Unlocked by level, not wargear). Farseer = 5 (Psychic Bolt have a total of 13 child abilities). Shadowseer = 2. Avatar = 8. Laughing God = 10.
	Shining Spears Exarch acquires a single melee blow at level 5.
	Scatter Beam skill (fireprism) now works, let me know your impressions because I didn't have a clear idea on how you wanted it to be.
	Entanglement and Mind War (Farseer) are now incompatible with a new wargear (Farseer)
	wraithtomb_of_khaine (300 health regen of the Revenant Titan) now prevents the user from moving
	Gracious Mercy (Shadowseer) now gives x10 -> x1.5 Health and Morale (Skill UI is updated but I didn't use UCS)

	haywire_bombs and haywire_bombs_2 (used by Warp Spiders only) have dramatically lowered damages and armour penetration so that they match other races' Krak Grenades
	Wailing Doom now deals much more damages 560-890 -> 680-1000. Morale damage doubled 75 -> 150
	Wrath of Khaine now deals much more damages 380-460 -> 420-680. Morale damage doubled 150 -> 300

	Removed morale buff given to vehicles by Autarch and Avatar. eldar_inspiring_autarch (10 morale regen) no longer affects any kind of vehicle. eldar_inspiring (Avatar) (morale immunity = invulnerability for shielded units) no longer affect any kind of vehicle
	Disambiguated the whole Nightwing Airstrike ability (created the _shining_spear_exarch), which has armour penetration and damage -10% rounded for excess (I cannot explain it, 0.3 -> 1) and costs REQ/POW 80/100

	eldar_resource_allocation_ally (doubles REQ income from a not armoured building) has recharge_timer_id set to 0, meaning that the cooldown is shared by all portals and actually has a global cooldown (so it no longer stacks)

	Soulstone nerfed like lore meant it to be, an emergency defense attack. Now it costs (REQ/POW) 1000/1000 (can be nothing compared to what the opponent could have spent for that unit, especially considered it is AOE). Moreover, now its cooldown is shared by all HQs. Against necrons creating more HQs and pressing on with them and uber turret perfectly works because of the Soulstone bombardment that takes place each time a threat is in sight.

	Plasma Grenades (AND plasma_grenades_2 [used at least by Warp Spiders]) are dramatically nerfed as they are superior to any other grenade. Radius 5 -> 7. Damage 300-400 -> 180-240. Damage and armour penetration still are far higher but I will not nerf it too much because I want to hear the player's opinion before. Plasma actually is stronger than frags, but for balancement purposes it cannot insta-kill basic units and force enemy commanders to flee in order to survive.

	+1 new abilities for the new Warp Spider Exarch (_2) [eldar_warp_spider_exarch_2_passive]

	+1 New ability - eldar_shuriken_barrage used by some vehicles
	Fleet on Foot (eldar_fleetoffoot) now applies a great accuracy debuff for the whole duration (-60% melee/ranged) and the speed bonus is reduced x3(not stack) -> +35%(can stack)

	Added a new ability infinity_resources (requires the addon) for the Eldritch Spire so that its effects do not disappear after relocation
	eldar_nuke and eldar_nuke2 now require the addon eldar_spire_stone_destruction. This way the Eldritch Spire can still cast even after relocation

	scholar_exorcist_inspiration [exorcist healing aura] no longer has 15m radius. It now affects the whole attached squad only.
	Bolster Defenses resistence buff (called "cover") no longer stacks (because it was OP, three concentrated Bolster defenses and ranged immortality could almost be reached) and area of effect is reduced from 10 meters to 8, cost is reduced to 40 (sandbags now only last 40 seconds)
	inquisition_frag_grenades_bodyguards (default grenades) now affect allies as well and affect all armour ratings (target_filter). It becomes incompatible with the standard Frag Grenades Research

	Melta Bombs and Frag Grenades of the Fire Support Lieutenant become incompatible after wargear
	Krak Bombing Run (Marauder Bomber) has effects more suitable for Krak Grenades rather than Inferno Grenades: (modifier) No longer applies fire effect nor health degeneration. (armour_damage) Damages now match Krak Grenades 1000-1380 -> 800-900, min damage 5 -> 0.3, morale damage 10 -> 0 (maybe in the future I'll add morale damages to Krak Grenades and Melta Bombs so that they damage shields. However NOT NOW). Armour penetration matches as well for: Vehicle 60 -> 100, Heavily Armoured Vehicle 40 -> 20, Structure 65 -> 50, Fortified Structure 40->25, Heavily Fortified Structure 25->10, Super Structure 0 -> 5, Living Metal 0 -> 10, Titan 0 -> 10. The file looks ravaged but it perfectly works
	new active targeted skill guard_emp_earthshaker (+many child abilities. Its effects replace those of the former weapon but will aim at the correct targets, which affected ALL armour types).

	+3 abilities (+ total 10 child abilities +3 aerial versions) guard_marauder_bombing_krak, guard_marauder_bombing_inferno, guard_marauder_bombing_smoke (replace Marauder Bomber former bombing runs) [are upgraded by Aerial Doctrine {UI updated accordingly}]

	Divine Retribution and Emperor's touch are disambiguated (to only make them passive and not all missionaries') and have _confessor after their name
	Witch Hammer, Divine Pronouncement and the two disambiguated Divine Retribution and Emperor's Touch become incompatible after wargear
	Some of the commanders unlock a Melta Bomb at level 5 {Almoness,Canoness,Ordo Hereticus,Nunciate Superior}

	ork_klan_nuddyfist has a new child and its target_filter now excludes all buildings and vahicles (not to cause them healing 15 in a 35m radius). Moreover, modifiers for maximum health and morale have been removed (moved to the child, where the effect was amplified 25 -> 40% but limited to the attached squad ONLY)
	+1 new ability ork_klan_nuddyfist_squad (child of ork_klan_nuddyfist)

TAU: Alpha Knarloc = 2. Great Ethereal = 5. Commander XV22 = 1. Commander XV89 = 2.
	1 disambiguation ability for the commander XV89 (target acquired). It has identical values but different requirements (replaced by a different wargear)
	Changed the requirements of target_acquired (used by the commander XV22, not XV89 anymore) so that it is replaced by the new target acquired wargear
	New ability: Improved Scanner (Guidance Beacon) after add-on. This ability is also incompatible with a new add-on.
	Renamed ability file from guard_detection_field_sp to tau_scanner (guard detection field sp is now deprecated, you can try deleting it but there should be a copy within DXP3. Too sad it had a misleading name...)
	2 New orbital strikes (Guidance Beacon) after add-on
	3 New nukes (Coalition Center) after one research each (researches are new [Diplomacy])
	3 New passive AOE passively casted by the Coalition Centers after each Diplomacy (new) research

	Titan Building has +3000 health 8000 -> 11000 (Like SM but it doesn't matter)
	HQ can spawn a new squad (Repair Drones)
	Generators (and Thermoplasma) now contain 2 new addons. Also, health_ext is updated (death_blossom). type_armour_2 is updated. Also a new ability is added (tau_generator_danger_hp_regen).

	Turret		-| Also have 3 passive abilities that drain power overtime (require Turret Upgrade Research)
	Removed Ripper Swarm researches and synapse/miasma from the Magma Vent (covering resource dumps as well). It's better to leave those stuff within the digest pool only.
	Fixed UI name and description of the Tyranids Digest Pool









	Units: The line "Compatibility matters" means = not obtainable but implemented for later use. [Already implemented but not included because it's not done for all races and it would require too much time and testing]

Commanders: The fastest way to check wargears is opening Corsix and going into arrib->research->factionname_wargear_unitname (the same applies to abilities). There are only few exceptions such as Eldar, which currently have the extension _spell instead of _wargear or IDH, which has a _skill for the Ordo Malleus.
	Relative to a commander I'll write as little as possible. In most cases I'll only note the EXTs that were changed
	Researches += New Wargears
	Abilities  += Matching New Wargears (same name)
	Weapons    += New Relative Wargears (very often same name, EG exceptions are CSM because they have ranged weapons in common)

	Following units now have a spawn_death_blossom: Bloodthirster, GUO, LoC, KoS, Warp Spawn, bloodthirster_angron (the Bloodthirster squad's member)

	Compatibility matters:
		Ravens have two weapons that replace the splinter cannon (thought to be temporary)
ELDAR:
	Fire Prism has smaller and more efficient weapon tables (combat_ext). No actual difference for the player (I am not sure but maybe the way it was back then would not work with the Scatterbeam ability, keeping it as it is now is safe)
	Warlocks (pseudoleaders, built within the squad, have different UI position/hotkey (I think?))
	Dire Avangers have +10 health and now they match DE Warriors in almost all aspects 340 -> 350

	GK Champion has the _possess ext
	NEW GK Champion _Improved (stronger brotherhood champion after wargear (like SM terminator armour))
	The following units have a different armour type screen name id (from "heavy infantry" to "elite heavy infantry") -> GK Terminator, GK Terminator Justicar, GK Paladin
	Acolytes, Sergeants, Exorcists (squad pseudoleader) only require both Librarium and Inquisition Watch instead of Bunker/Inquisition Watch (a weird one, not the HQ?. By the way, now it works better)
	New copy of the Exorcist _subleader and Astropath _subleader that are built within the squad. Using the same entity caused problem when trying to build him while another was attached. (long story short, thanks to this unit reinforcing works fine)

	Deepstike Turrets now cost exactly like ground turrets (req/pow) 120/60 -> 75/110

	Ordo Malleus:			Abilities, Researches, Weapons (HP 1), added death_explosion_death (damage morale of allies, like all other commanders), removed spawner_ext (nothing can be spawned from him, it's useless?), modifier_apply_ext disables leap (don't know why I did this...)
	Land Raider Daemonhunter:	Abilities (inquisition_wargear_inquisitor_lord_5 + inquisition_landraider_shield), HP (hardpoints) so that it can replicate SM land raiders (Inquisitor Lord wargear 6) {HP 1,2,4,6}. This uses SM weapons, not disambiguations, modifier_apply_ext (maybe disable HP + disable abilities + disable morale damage), event_manager (ability_tau_shield_event)

	GK_justicar had a misplaced hardpoint (9 that is now moved to 7). This meant that this Hammerhand was always active

	+2 new endgame units: xanthite_inquisitor and xanthite_cultist

	Riders squad cost increased by 25: 150 -> 175. Reinforce cost remains unaffected (25)

	guard_leaders_vox_caster no longer has all_infiltration (stealths whole squad. Airborne Kasrkin already had it so their VOX should still be infiltrated)

	Lieutenant Field:		Abilities (+Bolster Defenses I and II), Researches, Weapon (HP 1 guard_plasma_pistol_captain -> guard_plasma_pistol_field_lieutenant ) [This disambiguation prevents the General's Targeting Optics Research from further upgrading the Lieutenant's attack range and damages])
	Lieutenant Fire:		Abilities (+Bolster Defenses I and II), Researches, Weapons (HP 1,2,3,4,5)

	All Lemanruss have +10% health: Battletank 5000->5500, Battletank_advance_sp 6000->6600, Annihilator 6000->6600, Conqueror 6200->6820, Demolisher 5700->6270, Eradicator 6200->6820, Executioner 6200->6820, Exterminator 6200->6820, Inferno 6000->6600, Murderer 7000->7700, Punisher 5600->6160, Vanquisher 6200->6820, Vanquisher_Command 3000->3300

Sergeant (guard_infantry_guardsmen_sergeant) hotkey_l -> I, Kasrkin Sergeant (guard_infantry_kasrkin_sergeant) hotkey_s -> I, leaders_psyker_command_squad (used in the command squad) S -> P. Now hotkeys are a square and no longer interfere with Reinforce and Attack Move and Stop instructions, which was a real pain in the neck.

	Marauder Bomber Bombing Runs replaced by ones of my own (guard_marauder_bombing_krak, guard_marauder_bombing_inferno, guard_marauder_bombing_smoke) and the Aerial version of each one

	Following vehicles (with dozer blade) now have a new ability (dozer_blade_upgrade_ability): chimera_kronus, laser_destroyer, lemanruss_demolisher, lemanruss_eradicator

	All Lemanruss Tanks (not lemanruss_vanquisher_command) can now upgrade lateral weapons with flamer melta and plasma in this sequence. Also, the Lemanruss Battletank heavy stubber is now a weapon upgrade, so it's not enabled by default anymore		
	Following Lemanruss Tanks now have Heavy Bolter and then Lascannon as weapon upgrade on the hull (hardpoint 2) {Vanquisher HAD bolter/flamer/lascannon} {Punisher HAD bolter/flamer} {Exterminator HAD bolter/flamer} {Executioner had lascannon} {Demolisher had flamer} {Annihilator HAD lascannon} {}
	Because of the previous change the Annihilator can no longer equip lateral lascannons, which seemed to be not lore wise, but now has a heavy stubber on hardpoint 3 (please someone fix it's model attacks for stubber, lateral weapons and bolter hull default weapon)
	lemanruss_vanquisher_command now has different weaponry. Lateral cannons Heavy Bolter -> Plasma Cannon 
	Fixed the missing names of the following Lemanruss Tanks (I used text fields, not UCS): Punisher, Vanquisher, Conqueror, Eradicator, Exterminator

	Compatibility matter:
		Both Scarabs and Builder Scarabs have a shield event

SM:
	Honor Guard Gladiator:		Removed Buff from level 7 (this would have been the only "honor squad" other than Kroot Shapers that is buffed by level 7, I'd rather use a wargear or something like that to make them stronger)

	Chaplain_advance_sp (terminator armour) has revamped combat_ext [uses the same weapons as the Force Commander in Terminator Armour]: HP 1 contains Heavy Flamer and Assault Cannon too, HP 2 contains Storm Shield, HP 3 contents are moved to HP 4, HP 3 contains space_marine_missile_launcher_cyclone_commander.
	Chaplain in Terminator Armour now has now +10 addons and +4 abilities

	Hospitallers (sisters_curia) can no longer use any grenade (they had all 4. It looked horrible with the Ordo Hereticus)

	Changed Hotkey of following squad leaders to avoid conflicts with common shortcuts sisters_: celestian_imagifer (all Imagifers) L -> I, veteran_superior_celestian E -> L, repentia_mistress Q -> M (Missionaries are Y so it does not generate a conflict, I checked beforehand)

NECRONS:Nothing

SM: Nothing
	Legionaries have different squad_transportable_ext as they now count as inquisition_infantry (I just needed one so that they would not be deepstriked ever again. Streams of DS tanky and harmful units are a pain)
	Scout squads can now select 2 new leaders too (leader_sniper + leader_shotgun)
	space_marine_squad_honor_guard_gladiator have different leaders {1,2,3}, using now the _leader version (avoid issues when choosing leaders while one of the same type is attached)

SOB: Nothing
	sisters_inquisitor_squad squad_leader_ext has multi_with_upgrades set to false, improving how leaders are selected ingame (becomes like eldar Gravity Platforms instead of SM squads [More of the same type can be queued up to leader limit instead of limit-1 where limit>1])

TAU: Added the morale stat to DS drone squads (for shields with UP researches). Without shields, broken morale does not debuff the squad in any way. (Does not affect stats in any way, this was for compatibility with some old stuff I did)
	Added morale to the following squads: Broadside Battlesuits + 100: 600 -> 700. Crisis Suit +400: 600 -> 1000. Sunfire Battlesuit +1000: 600 -> 1600. Hazard Suit +1100: 900 -> 2000.

TYRANIDS: Removed the attach command to Lictor, Lictor Alpha, Hive Tyrant, Zoanthrope, Swarmlord. Doing so only resulted in reducing squad effectiveness while not granting any benefit or not making sense (swarmlord + spinegaunt? lictor alpha + something slower?).
	Added "cannibalize" to all squads except for titans, relic units, builders, spores. Speed is yet to be tweaked and the animation is required in some cases (Hive tyrant)
	Added squad_jump_ext to the Lictor Alpha (after wargear [new])

	Weapons: Amount-NAME-(ranged/melee) This counts players' available weapons. For example if an addon unlocks 2 different weapons with the same appearance and similar stats I will only count one and mark it with a * per hidden weapon (the file has the _2 , _3 extension and so on). D means disambiguation. Also I will not note UP weapons as they are not used (but required because of compatibility with my addon)

Copied from blaster and amplified modifiers caused by this weapon.

Added some new icons into ingame_disabled to preven pink icons when requirements are not fulfilled (Eldar [eldar_wargear06][eldar_wargear10], IG [tanktrap2], Necrons [necron_shield_off], Tau [shield_dome_icon][shield_dome_research]) I may have forgotten some. When you move files you can easily check which images are on one side but not on the other.

Scar
Aircraft.scar has a different style and no longer restricts Attack Scarabs, while it now includes all three new races.

CD now have 1 random Defiler and a Greater Warp Spawn instead of 3 Greater Warp Spawns. IDH 2 GK Terminators are replaced by 1 GK Terminator, 1 Calculus Logi, 2 Assault Servitor, 2 Weapon Servitor
addon_startingarmy_transport no longer spawn 2 bikes for CSM. 2 Bodyguards for IDH are now replaced by real transpots: 1 Rhino, 1 Razorback and 1 Chimera. Tyranids 2 Zoanthropes are replaced by 2 Tyrant Guards. CD have 2 random defilers

restrict_tierv (restrict game enders [titans/superweapons etc]) now prevents Eldar Shadowseer to purchase the nuke ability

KNOWN BUGS
IDH shock_troops (Stormtroopers) become almost completely invisible when the Missile Launcher weapon is purchased (model actually disappears, only a little piece remains). I don't know how to deal with this.
