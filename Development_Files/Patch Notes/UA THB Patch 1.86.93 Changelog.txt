|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

NEW CREDITS:
- Thudmeizer - For every single AI revamped.
- Eranthis Aconite for loads of new 1.87 content.
- Zany Reaper - TTRU mod for Shining Spears and more unit sounds.
- Q-ZERO for the new Avatar of Khaine structure, Obelisk/Pyramid textures.

[12:17:52 AM] Thud meizer: Necrons
Network Production Research has no disabled icon.
Stormblade and Stormsword icons look out of place compared to others in the Mars Pattern.
[12:19:12 AM] Thud meizer: Eldar
Falcon Grav Tank - icon for Shurikens has an odd greyed out colour that does not match other weapons. It should look consistent.
[12:19:18 AM] Jonathon: remember in our game cylarne that there was a purple icon for retributors. Pretty sure incorporating the heavy bolter as an addon weapon causes this
[12:20:01 AM] Thud meizer: I noticed also for IG many odd greyed out icons that don't match or are not consistent with other disabled icons
[12:20:12 AM] Thud meizer: ie. Stormtroopers from Array
[12:20:29 AM] Thud meizer: They are light coloured disabled while others are more darker. :|
[12:20:40 AM] Thud meizer: Should be across the board consistent.
LOCALIZER -- Requested string ID '719401' does not exist!
LOCALIZER -- Requested string ID '719402' does not exist!
