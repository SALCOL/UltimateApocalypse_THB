Changes made by Salcol:
------------------------
New: [need icons]
- Added 2 new researches after Convoy Upgrade (one of which makes Convoys transform into another Convoy type which allows 1 Techpriest garrison)
- Added 10 wargears to the Dais of Destruction
- The Taurox can now be created from the Mechanized Command (I had to move most vehicles and their unlocking addon)

Stat changes:
- Tweaked all transport types so that Mars Pattern Convoys can only contain Enginseers (No ingame differences)
- Mars Pattern Convoys can no longer transport neither infantry nor commanders
- Reduced the range of my 2 Target Acquired upgrades by 20m (60 -> 40)
- Cherubim Infiltration no longer stealths the rest of the squad
- Reduced speed bonus to the Confessor from the Fervor Wargear (passive ability)
- One of the Haemonculus and CSM wargears provided a morale regeneration buff to nearby enemies
- Dramatically weakened all CSM new wargears

Fixes:
- Re-implemented some stuff that was lost (Stormtrooper Volley gun/Necron Lord Weapon/Overseer Model)
- CD Fury portrait no longer becomes pink
- IDH Shock Troops no longer have have a pink portrait if they equip Missile Launchers

Bugs:
- IDH Shock Troops still lose their model if they equip Missile Launchers

Wargears:
- Chapter Master and Force Commander in Terminator Armour can no longer buy wargears which do not affect themselves
- Chaos Lord in Terminator Armour can no longer buy wargears which do not affect himself
- Adapted DPS of most commander's weapon upgrades. AP is scaled on a certain factor while DPS is divided for the same value. DPS is not affected but is displayed correctly even on the wargear which allows their use.
- The Autarch's Executioner no longer applies debuffs when attacking (60% disable abilities & 60% disable movement)
- guard_wargear14 now has a name (Heroic Senior Officer Promotion)
- Removed one nasty wargear from the Chaos Lord (Terminator Armour as well)

Fixes:

- tyranids_carnifex_implent_research now affects both min and max damage instead of only one (DPS unchanged)
- Ethereal Great Illusion range is now global (seeing the range was horrible)
- Added the colored version of the icons I used
- Fixed/adjusted some stuff with my additional LP addons (price, requirements, animation, name)
- LoC Chains of Torment no longer affect the caster as well
- LoC Hellfire requires the LoC to stay still

Stat changes:
- Furies default weapon stun effects have been lowered (they shouldn't be there in the first place)
- Slightly increased the stun effects and damages of the Fury stun melee attacks
- Furies now unlock in hardpoint2 the fire breath mentioned in the [gift4] research
- Nerfed CD LP auras
